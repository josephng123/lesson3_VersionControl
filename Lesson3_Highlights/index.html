            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control manages and tracks the changes made to a file and keeps a record of, obviously, the different versions. Version control has also spanned from basic local version controlling to Centralized Version Control Systems to even Distributed Version Control Systems. Each type of system builds upon each other, where local is kept on your own computer, to how centralized is based from another computer on the network, to distributed which keeps data on a server where multiple computers can fetch data. It is interesting to see how version controlling has evolved and how the different systems have become revolutionized to fit the needs of developers.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The way Github stores data is much different than that of other version control systems as it interprets and saves data differently, in the most efficient way possible. First, it takes each commit and reads it, verifying if any changes are made. If there appear to be no changes, then the file remains the same as the last, but if changes appear to be made, then a new version of the file is saved. I think Github is a valuable resource as it shows can show different stages of code in a way that a file can also be reversed if needed, and especially with this course, errors made can be easily fixed with different versions easily being available.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Three States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in Git reside in essentially three states which are committed, modified, and staged. In the committed state, data is still stored on a local drive or database while modified data is data that has been changed, but not committed. Finally, staged data consists of the changed data that is ready to be committed to a repository. Since these states are distinctly classified, it makes it easy to identify where you are in the process of development, which seems the most interesting to me. Also, this makes it easy to organize the tasks at hand in order to work the most efficiently.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Workflow</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The workflow within Git consists of the Working Tree, Staging Area, and Git directory. These sections also lie within the three states of Git, respectively. With the Working Tree, the files are modified as needed to perfect the data. Then, staging occurs in the Staging Area, which Github saves the version that has been completed at that point. Finally, the Git directory is where the final commit occurs and where the final version of the content is saved. It is intriguing to me how the attention of detail is paramount in managing data and also how an acute attention to detail is necessary with this course.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repositories are what data is kept in and they also track the changes made to the files as well. For Github, repositories can be initialized and clones with certain commands, ensuring how files can be stored and accessed in a way that best suits the user. It is important to keep track of how files are stored, and repositories are a great way to stay organized. Also, repositories are pertinent to this course because they show a history of the content and changes made to it.</p>
